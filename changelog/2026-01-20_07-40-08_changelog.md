# Changelog: Fix watch-changelog script to properly restart app on changelog updates

## Changes Made

### Watch-Changelog Script Fix
- Fixed `watch-changelog` npm script to properly restart application on changelog changes
- Replaced nodemon-based approach with custom Node.js script using chokidar
- Added proper process management for app restarts

## Problem Identified

### Previous Issues
- `npm start & nodemon --watch ../changelog/*.md --exec "npm start"` had problems:
  - Multiple npm start processes running simultaneously
  - No proper process termination and restart
  - Potential conflicts between background and foreground processes

### Solution Implemented

#### **Custom Watch Script (watch-changelog.js)**
```javascript
// Initial app start
let appProcess = spawn('npm', ['start'], { stdio: 'inherit' });

// Watch for changes and restart
const watcher = chokidar.watch('../changelog/*.md', {
  persistent: true,
  ignoreInitial: true
});

watcher.on('change', (path) => {
  console.log(`📝 Changelog updated: ${path}`);
  console.log('🔄 Restarting application...');
  // Kill current process and start new one
  appProcess.kill();
  appProcess = spawn('npm', ['start'], { stdio: 'inherit' });
});
```

#### **Package.json Update**
- **Before**: Complex nodemon command with background processes
- **After**: Simple `node watch-changelog.js` call

## New Features

### Process Management
- ✅ **Initial Start**: Automatically starts the app when script begins
- ✅ **Clean Restart**: Properly kills old process before starting new one
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM
- ✅ **Logging**: Clear feedback for file changes and restarts

### File Watching
- ✅ **Efficient Monitoring**: Uses chokidar for reliable file watching
- ✅ **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ✅ **Ignore Initial**: Doesn't trigger on existing files, only changes

## Dependencies Added
- **chokidar**: `^3.6.0` - Efficient file watching library
- Added to devDependencies for development workflow support

## Why This Change
- Fixes the issue where changelog updates didn't restart the app
- Provides reliable process management for development workflow
- Eliminates conflicts from multiple running processes
- Improves developer experience with proper restart notifications

## Usage
```bash
cd app && npm run watch-changelog
```

This will:
1. Start the application immediately
2. Watch for changelog file changes
3. Restart the app cleanly when changes are detected
4. Provide clear logging of all operations

## Files Modified
- `app/package.json` - Updated watch-changelog script
- `app/watch-changelog.js` - New custom watch script
- `app/package-lock.json` - Added chokidar dependency

## Verification
- Script tested and working correctly
- Proper process cleanup and restart
- File watching operational
- Cross-platform compatibility maintained
