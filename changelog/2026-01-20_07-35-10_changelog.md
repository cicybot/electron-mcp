# Changelog: Reduce preload.js sleep time from 2s to 1s

## Changes Made

### Preload Script Optimization
- Reduced sleep time in `app/preload.js` from 2 seconds to 1 second
- Updated both Windows and Unix-like platform sleep commands
- Improved application startup speed

## Technical Details

### Commands Updated
**Windows:**
- Before: `timeout /t 2 /nobreak >nul`
- After: `timeout /t 1 /nobreak >nul`

**Unix-like (macOS/Linux):**
- Before: `sleep 2`
- After: `sleep 1`

### Purpose of Sleep
The sleep command in preload.js provides a brief pause after killing existing Electron processes and before starting the new application. This prevents potential conflicts during rapid restarts.

### Impact
- **Startup Time**: Reduced by 1 second
- **User Experience**: Faster application restarts
- **Functionality**: Maintains process cleanup safety
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Why This Change
- Requested by user to reduce startup delay
- 1 second provides sufficient safety margin for process cleanup
- Improves development workflow speed
- No functional impact on application behavior

## Files Modified
- `app/preload.js`

## Verification
- Script syntax validated
- Cross-platform compatibility maintained
- Process cleanup logic preserved
