        "answer": "The problem is fundamentally about solving real-world AI at scale. We need to handle edge cases - the rare situations that can happen in driving. But we're making progress. The data flywheel is real. More fleet data = better AI = safer driving = more customers = more data. This positive feedback loop is powerful.",
